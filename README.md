What is Rack

Rack is the underlying technology behind nearly all of the web frameworks in the Ruby world. "Rack" is actually a few different things:

    An architecture - Rack defines a very simple interface, and any code that conforms to this interface can be used in a Rack application. This makes it very easy to build small, focused, and reusable bits of code and then use Rack to compose these bits into a larger application.
    A Ruby gem - Rack is is distributed as a Ruby gem that provides the glue code needed to compose our code.
